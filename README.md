# Medulloblastoma-Spatial-Biology

Our project aims to generate a 3D molecular atlas to unravel the intricate molecular evolution of highly heterogeneous Group 3 and 4 medulloblastomas (MBs), common pediatric brain tumors. We'll achieve this by integrating various spatial multiomics technologies, including spatial transcriptomics, spatial chromatin accessibility profiling, and mass spectrometry imaging (MSI) for metabolomics, lipidomics, and protein marker identification.

This comprehensive approach will allow us to resolve subgroup specific gene regulatory networks, epigenetic states, and visualize metabolic/lipidomic heterogeneity across distinct tumor niches. By correlating spatially resolved cell states with metabolic reprogramming, we'll gain critical insights into how stem-like progenitor regions transition to differentiated, proliferative zones within these tumors. Ultimately, integrating these diverse data layers will pinpoint spatially constrained therapeutic targets in MB subtypes, guiding future translational research.
